# Curriculum Vitae

These are the Latex sources for my academic CV.

**Download** the latest compiled PDF: 
[leonardo_uieda_cv.pdf](https://github.com/leouieda/cv/raw/pdf/leonardo_uieda_cv.pdf)

## Template

I made my own template after using `moderncv` for a while.
I wanted a cleaner look and something that is more unique (as much as an academic
CV can be).
It was also a chance for me to learn some Latex templating (and procrastihack a
little).
You're free to reuse and modify this template under the terms of the BSD
3-clause License (see `LICENSE.txt`).

A PDF is compiled automatically by TravisCI with every commit to the *master* branch
and uploaded to the *pdf* branch.

I highly recommend using the `Makefile` to build the PDF by running:

    make

Use `make clean` to remove all generated files.
