\textbf{Why is my research important?
How will I approach it?
What are my long term research goals?
What are my career goals?}

As a geophysicist,
my ultimate goal is
to infer knowledge about the inner Earth
and its processes
from surface observations,
such as it's gravity and magnetic fields,
topography,
or propagation patters of seismic waves.
%
Ubiquitous to all geophysical methods is
the fact that this inference is
an ill-posed inverse problem,
to which a solution might not exist or be non-unique and unstable.
%
Many methods have been developed over the years
to solve inverse problems
in all fields of geophysics.
%
The complexity and scale of
the inversions tackled has increased
with advances in computer technology.
%
Thus,
cutting edge research
in geophysical inversion
requires dominion not only of the mathematical basis
but of the computational tools currently available.
%
My main research focus is
the development of new inversion methods
and the software that implements them.


Creating a new inversion method
requires a solid base of well tested
forward modeling and linear algebra code.

Projects and what I have done.

Future research.
